# About the Project
Hey folks, this is my first project in html and css. A pretty basic and barebones clone of the [amazon.com](https://amazon.com) website. 

I followed the Apna College videos to learn [html](https://youtu.be/HcOc7P5BMi4?si=yx9w1WhKRDddILyf) and [css](https://youtu.be/ESnrn1kAD4E?si=QjfQrbmAUAfd8fKp). This project is also a part of the video. 

# Project Description
This project incorrectly uses some of the semantic html tags(I believe it has been done this way to keep it simple).
